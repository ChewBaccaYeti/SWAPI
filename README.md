You need to install dependencies first

# npm install

After that you can run command to start server

# npm run pipe

You can now open http://localhost:3030 URL and there scroll a bit down to see UI cards (you will see raw response first in JSON)

Or you can go to one of the endpoints designated below:
http://localhost:3030/people
https://swapi.dev/api/starships
https://swapi.dev/api/species

And ther you can get raw/parsed JSON response
